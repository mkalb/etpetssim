# Extraterrestrial Pets Simulation

## Overview
Welcome to the **Extraterrestrial Pets Simulation** project (_etpetssim_)!
This open-source project aims to create various simple 2D simulations with a top-down view.
The first subproject is a variant of "WaTor", and additional similar simulations (_Toy models_, _Agent-Based Models_)
will be added over time.

## Goals
- Explore and apply modern Java features in practice.
- Get to know the JavaFX library and gain some initial experience with it.
- Enjoy creativity in developing new simulations and adapting well-known models.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language used throughout the project.
- **JavaFX**: Used to create the graphical user interface.
- **Gradle**: Build system used for the project, including a Gradle wrapper.
- **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**: The development environment ("IDE") of choice, provided by JetBrains.

This project uses the latest stable versions of all technologies whenever possible.
